# CGAN-for-Semantic-Segmentation
Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for semantic segmentation of satellite imagery 

## Overview
This initiative explores the development of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model tailored for segmenting satellite imagery. While this technique holds promise for enhancing image analysis for land use analysis, itâ€™s important to note that the project, in its current form, has not yet achieved results suitable for high-stakes applications.

## Project Scope
The model architecture and training process are designed with the following components:

- **Data Preparation**: Images and corresponding masks are processed and augmented to train the model effectively.
- **Generator and Discriminator Models**: The core of the CGAN framework, where the generator aims to produce realistic image segmentations, and the discriminator evaluates their authenticity.
- **Training Workflow**: A combined setup where both components learn together, with the goal of improving segmentation accuracy.
- **Visualization and Evaluation**: Tools integrated into the workflow to periodically check the model's performance by visualizing predictions against actual data.

## Implementation Note
This project is intended to be run in a Google Colab environment. Colab provides the necessary computational resources and simplifies the setup process, allowing for a smoother development and testing experience.

## Current Project Status
It's crucial to highlight that, while the project demonstrates the CGAN methodology applied to satellite imagery segmentation, the outcomes so far may not meet the threshold required for critical application areas. The team has encountered challenges in achieving the level of precision necessary for such purposes.


## Contributions and Feedback
We welcome contributions from the community, whether it's improving the model's architecture, enhancing the data preprocessing steps, or refining the overall workflow. If you have any suggestions or would like to discuss potential improvements, please feel free to reach out.

## Note on Use
Given the project's exploratory nature and current limitations, we advise caution in deploying this model for high-value decision-making processes. We encourage further research and development to reach the robustness necessary for such applications.
